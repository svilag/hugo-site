As part of a course in Digital Curation, I coauthored a data paper titled, "Exploring the Tweets They Didnâ€™t Want Us To See: Tweet Contents and Account Data from the Politwoops Archive".
<!--more-->

For this data paper, myself and my colleagues analyzed a dataset of deleted tweets made by public officials. The dataset was originally published by the Sunlight Foundation and is currently hosted on ProPublica. In the paper, we discuss some basic facts about the dataset, the methods used to gather the data, the potential for reuse of the data, significant properties and restraints on the reuse of the data, conduct a threat assessment of the data format, and provide recommendations for further curation.[^1]

**Abstract:** Politwoops is a digital archive hosted by ProPublica which publishes deleted tweets from public political officials or individuals campaigning to hold public office, while the accompanying dataset, in the form of a downloadable CSV file, offers further information on the owners of the accounts themselves such as political party, Twitter ID, and official government title. The tweets are collected using the Twitter API; Politwoops has its own Twitter account through which it follows officials and collects their tweets, taking note of which ones are subsequently deleted. The information in the CSV file is updated according to the needs of the archive; individuals who are no longer public figures and no longer tracked by the organization are removed from the file, while others are added when needed.
