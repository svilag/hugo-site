As part of a course in Digital Curation, I coauthored a data paper titled, "Exploring the Tweets They Didnâ€™t Want Us To See: Tweet Contents and Account Data from the Politwoops Archive".
<!--more-->

For this data paper, myself and my colleagues analyzed a dataset of deleted tweets made by public officials. The dataset was originally published by the Sunlight Foundation and is currently hosted on ProPublica. In the paper, we discuss some basic facts about the dataset, the methods used to gather the data, the potential for reuse of the data, significant properties and restraints on the reuse of the data, conduct a threat assessment of the data format, and provide recommendations for further curation.[^1]
