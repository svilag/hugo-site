As part of a course in Interaction Design, I designed and prototyped an application utilizing different user research techniques including competitive analysis, interviews, creating personas, story mapping, creating user flow diagrams, and prototyping in Adobe XD. My prototype focused on helping people with food allergies find places to eat near them that offered allergen friendly options.

**The assignment:** create an IXD solution surrounding a specific problem (eating well with food allergies), utilizing various research techniques including competitive analysis, interviews, creating personas, story mapping, creating user flow diagrams, and prototyping in Adobe XD.

**The Product:** The end result for this project is an interactive prototype created using Adobe XD (or Figma, etc.).

7. From that user flow diagram, I was able to create an interaction map of these user interactions.
8. After
