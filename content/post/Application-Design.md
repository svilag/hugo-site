As part of a course in Interaction Design, I designed and prototyped an application utilizing different user research techniques including competitive analysis, interviews, creating personas, story mapping, creating user flow diagrams, and prototyping in Adobe XD. My prototype focused on helping people with food allergies find places to eat near them that offered allergen friendly options.

**The assignment:** create an IXD solution surrounding a specific problem (eating well with food allergies), utilizing various research techniques including competitive analysis, interviews, creating personas, story mapping, creating user flow diagrams, and prototyping in Adobe XD.

**The Product:** The end result for this project is an interactive prototype created using Adobe XD (or Figma, etc.).

**The Process:**

1. **Frame** the problem. What are the key issues?
2. Get to know the **users**. Who needs this type of solution? What are those needs?
3. Get to know the **competitors** and others in the **market**. What other products exist that are similar? Who are the main competitors?
4. Create **personas**.
5. Map the **User Flow**.
6. Map the **User Interactions**.
7. **Wireframe** Prototype.
8. **Low-Fidelity** Prototype.
9. **Mid-fidelity** Prototype.

## Pulling it All Together

### The Problem

I explored a problem that people with food allergies face when eating out. Often times it can be difficult to find suitable places to eat to ensure they won't get sick from cross contamination or unknowledgable staff, or any other reasons. This is a particular problem for people with gluten sensitive conditions, such as Celiac Disease and non-Celiac sensitivity, but there is a similar problem for people with other food allergies as well. Current applications that enable restaurant search are not very good at picking out the allergen-friendly locations, and very often include results that are not even relevant, frustrating the user and making them spend more time researching a safe place to eat.

### The Users

#### User interviews

To gather information about what user needs and feelings regarding the topic, I interviewed five individuals and asked them a set of questions about their eating habits, things they typically buy at the grocery store, etc., in order to get an idea of what some of the positive and negative points of eating with or without a food allergy. I interviewed people that were adhereing to vegetarian, dairy free, and gluten free diets, and people that had no dietary restrictions. This variety of interviewees enabled me to gain valuable insight into the needs of people dealing with different food allergies.

#### The Market

To further gain an understanding of the space this app could be competing in, I took a look at the surrounding market, identifying other applications and websites that offered similar servcies or that competed in a similar space.

#### Personas

The information gained from the user interviews was helpful, and enabled me to formulate some user personas of people who may use the application. Knowing a bit about the other solutions available on the market was also helpful in conceptualizing this user base. These personas, while fictional scenarios, center the design problem around the thing that matters most in design: the people using the tools.

### Building the Prototypes

Each prototype was assembled using Adobe Creative Cloud products, including Illustrator and XD. Two different fidelity prototypes were created, including a low-fidelity wireframe and a mid-fidelity interactive prototype. The wireframes were helpful to get a basic feel of how interactions would flow within the app. The wireframe prototype also helped to pinpoint some areas where the design could use improvement. From the wireframes, the mid-fidelity prototype was built, adding more detail including text, some images, and assigning interactions withing Adobe XD.
