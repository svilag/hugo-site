As part of a course on SQL and Databases, I created a database in MySQL from the data collected from my Undergraduate Capstone project, "_237 Letters_".
<!--more-->

**The assignment:** select a dataset and create a database in MySQL from that data.

**The Data:** The dataset I used included metadata about 237 letters in the Eastern Michigan University Archives that I used as a part of my undergraduate capstone project in History. These letters were sent to Eastern Michigan Regents in protest of Civil Rights Activist Julian Bond speaking at the January 1971 commencement and receiving an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree.

**The Process:**

1. First I had to design the database. How was I going to normalize this data so that it could be easily queried?
2. Then, I had to process the data. One CSV had to become six, one for each table that would go into the database.
3. Once I had my tables set as CSV files, I used JetBrains Datagrip to import the data into my database server.
4. After the data was in, I set up my keys to ensure my tables were linked.
5. Ready to query!
